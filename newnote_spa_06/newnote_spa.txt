QUESTION:

Create a diagram depicting the situation where the user creates
a new note using the single page version of the app


SOLUTION:

note over browser:
data (request: POST) is sent to server  with form submit
end note

browser->server: HTTP POST https://fullstack-example.herokuapp.com/new_note_spa

note over server:
server instructs the browser to reload the Notes page
with a redirect
end note

note over browser: 
the POST request now contains JSON-data which comprises
both the content and the date
the Content-Type header of the request tells the server that the
included data is a JSON format

server-->browser: responds with status code 201

note over server:
this time the server does not ask for a redirect
end note

note over browser:
the browser stays on the same page and 
it sends no further HTTP request
it uses Javascript to manipulate the view display at 
the background
end note
